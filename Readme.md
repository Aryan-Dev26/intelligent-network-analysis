# Intelligent Network Anomaly Detection System

AI-powered network security analysis using machine learning to identify suspicious traffic patterns in real-time.

## Overview

This system captures network traffic, processes it through a sophisticated feature engineering pipeline, and applies unsupervised machine learning (Isolation Forest) to detect anomalies. The project demonstrates end-to-end ML engineering from data capture to web visualization, built over 3 weeks with systematic development approach.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **Data Capture Engine**: Simulated network packet generation with realistic protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP)
- **Feature Engineering Pipeline**: 26+ features including time patterns, protocol analysis, and statistical metrics
- **ML Detection System**: Isolation Forest algorithm with 10% contamination threshold for anomaly detection
- **Web Interface**: Flask dashboard with real-time analytics and professional responsive UI

### Data Processing Features

- IP address validation and network topology analysis
- Time-based pattern recognition (hour, day-of-week, weekend detection)  
- Statistical feature extraction (rolling means, standard deviations)
- Protocol classification and port categorization
- Packet size analysis and suspicious behavior flagging
- Min-Max normalization with parameter storage for model consistency

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python 3.13, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Framework**: Flask with Jinja2 templating
- **Frontend**: HTML5/CSS3 with responsive design and glass-morphism UI
- **ML Algorithm**: Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)
- **Development**: Git version control with professional practices

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aryan-Dev26/intelligent-network-analysis
cd intelligent-network-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
python src/web/app.py
# Visit http://localhost:5000
```

```

## Performance Metrics

- **Processing Speed**: 2-3 seconds for 50-packet batch analysis
- **Memory Usage**: Stable during operation with efficient resource management
- **Web Response Time**: <1 second dashboard load
- **Detection Accuracy**: ~10% anomaly detection rate (baseline established)
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supports easy feature expansion
